This is a simple and very useful bot to learn how to use discord.py

I recommend to view the dumentation for discord.py
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

I am not a expert with discord.py so use this repository for reference only.

You can copy and use this code for whatever you want.




## Roadmap
